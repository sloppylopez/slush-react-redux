                                IF you can read this means this website is working with a new CI/CD cycle using the recently
                                discovered Codefresh.io, it's free, it let's you run Docker containers, it has a lot of nice
                                features, easy to use, I mounted the whole pipeline in 1 day, and I will be able to do a dynamic
                                pipeline which was my next challenge, a free home made enterprise ready dynamic CI/CD pipeline.

                        <div>
                            <p>
                                I always wanted to write this article and today I'm bored so here we go.
                                First of all, what is self defence?, It's the opportunity to defend yourself when
                                you are threatened by an aggressor, that's obvious right? not so obvious is the
                                fact that an aggressor must be stronger than you to be considered self defence,
                                defending yourself from an unarmed boy it's not a really a challenge, but what happens
                                when the guy is bigger and badder than you?, then you have a problem, just like
                                when you find a bug that you don't know how to solve.
                            </p>
                            <p>
                                Now to put ourselves in situation, what happens if a girl has to defend herself from an
                                aggressor?
                                Well... her only chance is to kick him quick and to kick him hard, but how a girl it's
                                going
                                to knock out a guy with 1 hit?.
                                The answer is playing dirty, 1 punch in the Adam's apple and/or 1 kick in the balls or
                                even
                                1 finger into the eye it's more than enough to buy time to run, that is the only
                                possible
                                way out which is much better than nothing.
                            </p>
                            <p>
                                Even if you think the girl is so cool because she won and should feel happy to scape her aggressor
                                she will
                                probably regret what happened because the guy it's very likely to die or
                                get severely injured by the chin-chilla received, most likely she will have some kind
                                of judicial liability for the damage as a reward for her courage, which leads me to
                                stress the best
                                possible situations when dealing with and aggression.
                                <br></br>
                                <br></br>
                                When facing an aggression the possible scenarios are roughly this ones by order of
                                convenience:
                            </p>
                            <ul>
                                <li>
                                    1) You run singing 'If I were a rich man lalalalalalaaaaaaaaaa'
                                </li>
                                <li>
                                    2) Can't flee, so you provide your aggressor a severe corrective as detailed
                                    before,
                                    then you go to court to explain what happened and face the consequences,
                                    that's a bell you can't unring
                                </li>
                                <li>
                                    3) Both of you fight, you lose several teeth and bare scars all over your face,
                                    but when they
                                    ask you 'What happened?' the answer is 'You had to see how I left the other
                                    guy', this option is
                                    not court safe either.
                                </li>
                                <li>
                                    4) The guy kicks the shit out of you, period.
                                </li>
                            </ul>
                            <p>
                                When a bug appears while developing this are the possible ones:
                            </p>
                            <ul>
                                <li>
                                    1) It's not a bug, it's a false positive, maybe lack of attention, multitasking or
                                    the all times famous
                                    'forgot to refresh the browser'.
                                </li>
                                <li>
                                    2) You faced the bug before or it's trivial, with more of less effort it gets
                                    solved, hopefully with the optimal
                                    solution
                                </li>
                                <li>
                                    3) It's the first time you see it, so you Google it and the solution appears
                                    after fighting the problem
                                </li>
                                <li>
                                    4) You Google it but find only 3 entries talking about the bug in Japanese
                                    forums...
                                    you decide to move your ass from the chair and suffer the shame of asking your
                                    team mates, they know the problem and it gets solved.
                                </li>
                                <li>
                                    5) No one knows Jackshit about that bug, you are forever alone.
                                </li>
                            </ul>
                            <p>
                                The difference is: when the moment of truth comes (Case 5), you still have 2 options
                                left.
                                Either you solve the problem, or you find a workaround, a different way of approaching
                                the problem,
                                some people call it lateral thinking.<br></br>
                                99% of times the workaround option is a lousy trick that will introduce a technical debt
                                in the
                                code, which will have to be solved later, but sometimes there is room for genius magic,
                                like
                                when Einstein contradicted Sir Isaac Newton about gravity.

                                The moral of the history can be found in almost every single aspect of the
                                Asian Culture, including Mangas and suchlike, which is:
                                "When there's a problem, even if it looks impossible to solve and there is no hope left
                                you have to keep trying".<br></br>
                                But there is another lecture that can be extracted reading between the lines, keep
                                trying is not enough,
                                do you really think keep trying to hit a gorilla it's going to make
                                you succeed just because you are a Manga fanboy?, hell no, you have to play dirty,
                                playing dirty
                                means nothing but getting the maximum benefit with the minimum effort.
                            </p>
                            <p>
                                Bruce Lee used to say that you don't need to know 1000 techniques for every possible
                                situation,
                                as instead you should have just few tricks under your sleeve, but those tricks have to
                                be
                                the sharpest in terms of reward/effort when we use them to solve problems, and then
                                you must train until you master them, so you can use those skills naturally.

                                The wise man will be able to extract 1 more thing to remember from this story, in the
                                end, the most
                                important thing is to avoid conflicts in your real life, and to avoid by any means
                                having bugs in
                                your everyday duty, so we don't have to confront them, unfortunately this is not always
                                in our control, so we
                                need to be prepared when things go south.

                                The first 3 weeks were hard knock life, It was challenging to find a house
                                to rent, <a href='https://www.airbnb.com/'>Airbnb</a> saved my life, but
                                I was forced to roam from house to house every 2-3 days, it wasn't funny,
                                I recall sleeping in the bed with the puffy jacket chilling to the bone
                                because the host did not switch the heating on.
                            </p>
                            <p>
                                Fortunately I found a very small and pricey flat but that wasn't the end of
                                the problems off course.
                                It's a first floor flat and they were building a 'Restaurant' in the down floor,
                                so we had to suffer 2 months of drilling included in the price, thanks God I was going
                                to work to scape the noise most of the day, my girlfriend wasn't that lucky.
                            </p>
                            <p>
                                When it rains it pours so I didn't have internet at home at all the first 2 months,
                                imagine a Web Developer without internet connection in a new team with new technologies
                                trying to catch up with his colleagues.
                                Finally after all the problems I have a place to rest and work, so I decided
                                to continue working where I left it before leaving.
                            </p>
                            <p>
                                Despite all inconvenience, in this 3 months I had time to do 2 things, the first one was
                                migrating my website (again) to <a
                                href='https://webpack.github.io/'>Webpack</a> and <a
                                href='https://facebook.github.io/react/'>React</a> / <a
                                href='https://github.com/rackt/redux'>Redux</a>, the second was a NPM
                                module called <a href='https://elephantseed.firebaseapp.com/'>Elephant Seed</a>.
                            </p>
                            <p>
                                <a href='http://jspm.io/'>JSPM</a> it's gorgeous, you get a lot of goodies out of
                                the box practically doing nothing.
                                This website has been rebuilt 3 times, first was <a
                                href='https://github.com/sloppylopez/angruntlar'>Angruntlar</a>, then <a
                                href='https://github.com/sloppylopez/angulpar'>Angulpar</a>, and now it's
                                called <a href='https://github.com/sloppylopez/slush-react-redux'>Slush-React-Redux</a>.
                                In the end I decided to use <a href='http://jspm.io/'>JSPM</a> with <a
                                href='http://jspm.io/'>Babel</a> to have ES6 Sugar and minimum configuration.
                                This version has practically the same features as the other 2 but with much less files
                                and fewer lines of code, and even though I have not measured it yet, the
                                performance is better in practically every aspect surely.
                            </p>

                            <p>
                                I started <a href='https://elephantseed.firebaseapp.com/'>Elephant
                                Seed</a> after speaking with one of the developers
                                of my team, he showed me JSPM and I got interested, it tries to solve one of my major
                                complaints about Javascript
                                in the first article I wrote here, unifying the module dependency management
                                of your project, and your builds, and your bundling everything under the same roof.
                            </p>
                            <p>
                                In theory, with JSPM you don't need <a href='http://gulpjs.com/'>Gulp</a>, that's when I
                                decided to make a front-end
                                project without Gulp, just to see if it's possible to get the same goodies without
                                it.
                            </p>
                            <p>
                                My colleague also showed me <a href='http://slushjs.github.io/#/'>Slush</a>, it's a
                                scaffolding tool like <a href='http://yeoman.io/'>Yeoman</a> based on Gulp, so I decided
                                to create a seed for removing the boiler-plate of a front-end project using all this
                                technologies
                                and including all the features developers like, for example live reloading, bundling,
                                minifying
                                and so forth, all without the need to depend on Gulp and 20 different plug-ins.
                            </p>
                            <p>
                                In the end you want to develop your project with the minimum ammount of dependencies but
                                maintianing certains
                                features that are very usefull and time saving for dev's in development time and
                                even on production release phase.

                                I am very happy I managed to settle and get my stuff together today,
                                because tomorrow it's Big Pun's dead
                                anniversary and I want to dedicate this last words to him.<br></br>

                                Christopher Lee Rios from the Boogie Down (Bronx), teenage father of 3 kids, he had so
                                much struggles he even had to sleep
                                in the streets, despite all that and being considered the underdog for his Latin Rapper

                                Well well, I'm finally back, I was stuck because of the holiday in Spain and problems
                                I faced during the migration to <a
                                href='http://ant.apache.org/'>Gulp</a> :_)
                            </p>

                            <p>
                                It's funny what a Back-End developer like thyself can do nowadays with this <a
                                href='https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/JavaScript'>Javascript</a> frenzy we are living
                                lately.
                                I remember in ye olde times with the old good 1.6 JDK running the 'war' with <a
                                href='http://ant.apache.org/'>Apache Ant</a> tasks,
                                going for a coffee and after a fair amount of minutes having the web in your local up
                                and
                                running.

                                Your 'perfectly' object oriented model is sent to the <a

                                markups, eventually, you will use something called <a

                                make AJAX calls for sending data to the server, those were the days where you used to
                                write
                                in your CV that you knew <a

                                Then you have this entire eco-system of FOSS Js libraries supported by the community
                                that work every now and then which let you solve the problem of optimizing static

                                all this bunch of tools just to put a website online with 5-10 views and 2-3

                                I though well, I hope we are not sacrificing proper modelling...
                                Object modelling? you write 1 input markup using ng-model in <a
                                href='https://angularjs.org/'>AngularJS</a> and it's in the model per se, this
                                by all means makes really difficult to keep the discipline we had back in the day
                                discussing
                                15 minutes about why we need an extra attribute in this object,
                                as instead the model is the Wild West.

                                it has or what's going on inside of it, seems rather frustrating because
                                it's part of the bargain, some might say it's the charm of it, like having to chose

                                This is the brand new project I am working on lately, started on 23/04/2015, that's 9
                                weeks from today,
                                it is entirely developed in my spare time, as usual.

                            </p>

                            <p>
                                It all began with this <a
                                href='http://thepracticalsysadmin.com/running-elk-on-docker/'>article</a>.<br></br>
                                Was really exciting to see what <a href='https://www.docker.com/'>Docker</a> is able to
                                do, ELK stack was
                                quick
                                and easy to build following the tutorial, but soon I though maybe we could do something
                                interesting with the
                                <a
                                    href='https://www.elastic.co/'> Elastic Search</a>.<br></br>
                                So taking some random but useful data, in this case RSS news to persist on the Elastic
                                Search, gave me the
                                need
                                for a Client/Server scenario, therefore it came the <a href='https://angularjs.org/'>AngularJS </a>
                                client
                                and the <a href='https://nodejs.org/'>NodeJS</a> API to communicate the back-end
                                docker-based virtual
                                machines
                                with
                                the SPA <a
                                href='https://angularjs.org/'>AngularJS</a> web client.
                            </p>

                            <p>
                                At this point it would be nice if we could automate deployments and test coverage
                                reports, I used to
                                have a website online the last 3 years, it was completely unpleasant to maintain the
                                dev/release cycle
                                adding
                                new features to the website and making releases in my spare time, including testing
                                after the release.

                            </p>

                            <p>
                                I promised <a href='http://es.linkedin.com/in/sloppylopez'>myself</a> the next project
                                must have a CI-CD
                                cycle, it was very easy to achieve using the
                                wonders of <a href='https://travis-ci.org/sloppylopez/angulpar'>Travis</a> mixed up with

                                If we include <a href='https://github.com/sloppylopez'>Github</a> in the process, we
                                have
                                version control
                                in a powerful combination that removes tons of boilerplate work and process failures in
                                all the phases
                                of the dev/release cycle.

                                If we add 100% unit test coverage and e2e testing to the mix, topped up with <a
                                href='https://www.npmjs.com/package/istanbul'>Istambul</a> test coverage <a
                                href='https://codeclimate.com/github/sloppylopez/angulpar/coverage'>reports</a> and <a
                                href='https://codeclimate.com/github/sloppylopez/angulpar'>Code Climate</a> quality
                                checks, we find ourselves with a project resistant to human mistakes
                                across the whole cycle of dev/release.

                            </p>

                            <p>
                                The project is measurable, paired with <a
                                href='http://www.google.com/analytics/ce/mws/?utm_expid=71218119-7.lBgmrTO8R3uEDwsxNxa_Nw.1&utm_referrer=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.google.co.uk%2F'>Google
                                Analytics</a> gives the interesting possibility of measuring
                                the business value added for that feature, in that particular pull request.
                                We can measure how affects the performance of the web with tools like <a
                                href='https://gtmetrix.com/reports/sloppylopez.com/uwTHPa7e'>GTmetrix</a> and how
                                affects the <a href='https://codeclimate.com/github/sloppylopez/angulpar'>quality</a> of
                                code.<br></br>
                                if the pull
                                request diminishes the quality, the deployment will not happen and Travis will
                                automatically generate a
                                report.

                                After achieving this milestone we can focus on just adding business value to our
                                project,
                                that's <a href='http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Agile_management'>Agile</a>.<br></br>
                                We built a bare bones seed, with the minimum number of features to make the whole stack
                                work,
                                which also is ready for future growth and unavoidable human failures.<br></br>
                                We also have a clear and well defined process that anyone can follow and is documented,
                                idempotent,
                                automated and generates reports out-of-the-box.

                                This technologies offer corporations the chance to mitigate the need of certain roles
                                and processes,
                                they put a 'start-up' approach over the table since all the members of the team are
                                involved
                                in the dev/release cycle.

                                Figures like 'Release Manager' as for example become less relevant in the process, the
                                testing phase of
                                the cycle gets partially released of stress as well, in a big corporation this can be a
                                fair amount of
                                money.

                                The funny thing is that it possibly took Travis less time to verify if this website
                                works, send a
                                report to Code Climate and deploy the latest code in Firebase than it took you to read
                                this brief
                                introduction
                                to this humble project.
