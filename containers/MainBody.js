                            <p>
                                Hello again, I was missing in action for three months... a big opportunity
                                came to my life, I changed job, house and city all the same time!,
                                it wasn't really easy this time because I moved alone, even though my girl
                                came a month after.
                            </p>
                            <p>
                                I had very good memories of London for the last 3 years, it's a marvelous
                                city to live but I couldn't help felt in love with Amsterdam when I first came
                                with friends.I promised myself one day I'll work here somehow, I never really
                                though I will make it, took me more than 7 years programming to reach being
                                offered a job here.
                            </p>
                            <p>
                                I had tough times the first 3 weeks though, It was challenging to find a house
                                to rent, Airbnb saved my life, but I was roaming from house to house for 3 weeks,
                                it was a nightmare, I recall sleeping in the bed with the puffy snow jacket chilling
                                to the bone because the host did not switch the heating on.
                            </p>
                            <p>
                                Fortunately I found a very small and pricey flat, off course that wasn't the
                                end of the problems.<br></br>
                                It's a first floor and they were building a 'restaurant' in the down floor,
                                so I got 2 months of nice drilling included in the price, thanks God I was going
                                to work and the noise was avoided half of the day, my girlfriend wasn't that lucky.
                            </p>
                            <p>
                                Nobody said it will be easy, I was 2 months at home without internet as all over the
                                top, imagine a web developer without internet in a new team.
                                <br></br>
                                Finally after all the problems I have a place to rest and work, so I decided
                                to continue the work where I left it.
                            </p>
                            <p>
                                In this 3 months I had time to do 2 things, the first one is to migrate my website again
                                to Webpack and React/Redux, and to develop a NPM module called Slush-jspm-react-seed.
                            </p>
                            <p>
                                Webpack it's gorgeous, with minimum configuration you get a lot of goodies out of the
                                box.
                                this website has been rebuild 3 times, first was Angruntlar, then Angulpar, and now it's
                                called Slush-React-Redux.
                            </p>
                            <p>
                                This version has practically the same features as the other 2 but with much less files
                                and much less lines of code, and even though I have not measured it yet, I'm sure the
                                performance in better in practically every aspect.
                            </p>
                            <p>
                                The second project it's something I got into when speaking with one of the developers
                                of the new team, he showed me JSPM and I got fascinated by it, I would say it's not
                                production ready yet, but it tries to solve one of my major complaints about Javascript
                                in the first article I wrote here, it tries to unify the module/dependency management
                                of your project, and your builds, and your bundling, everything under the same tool.
                            </p>
                            <p>
                                In theory, with JSPM you don't need Gulp, that's when I decided to make a front-end
                                project without Gulp, just to see if it's possible to get the same goodies but without
                                it.
                            </p>
                            <p>
                                I was also very interested in seeds and build tools like Yeoman, so my colleague showed
                                me Slush with is like Yeoman but based on Gulp, which is used transparently for me, it's
                                just to build the seed after that there is no more Gulp involved.
                            </p>
                            <p>
                                This technology it's very recent, so I am encountering some problems in production mode,
                                I
                                am waiting for a release in January to see If I can advance, If not maybe I will have to
                                surrender, and start using Gulp for few tasks, or Monkey Patch.<br></br>
                                I can't wait to see how it ends.
                            </p>

                            <p>
                                Well well, I'm finally back, I was stuck because of the holiday in Spain and problems
                                I faced during the migration to <a
                                href='http://ant.apache.org/'>Gulp</a> :_)
                            </p>

                            <p>
                                It's funny what a Back-End developer like thyself can do nowadays with this <a
                                href='https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/JavaScript'>Javascript</a> frenzy we are living
                                lately.
                                I remember in ye olde times with the old good 1.6 JDK running the 'war' with <a
                                href='http://ant.apache.org/'>Apache Ant</a> tasks,
                                going for a coffee and after a fair amount of minutes having the web in your local up
                                and
                                running.
                            </p>
                            <p>
                                Your 'perfectly' object oriented model is sent to the <a
                                href='https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/JavaServer_Pages'>Jsp</a> and gets rendered with
                                'Jsp-esque'
                                markups, eventually, you will use something called <a
                                href='https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/JavaScript'>Javascript</a> to capture 1 click event
                                or
                                make AJAX calls for sending data to the server, those were the days where you used to
                                write
                                in your CV that you knew <a
                                href='https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/JavaScript'>Javascript</a>.
                            </p>
                            <p>
                                But your life can flip in a matter of seconds...
                                One day you wake up in the morning but you can't help yourself
                                tasting the flavour of <a
                                href='https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/JavaScript'>Javascript</a> while washing your teeth,
                                all of a sudden you see people
                                speaking about <a
                                href='https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/JavaScript'>Javascript</a> inside the office.

                                You run terrified towards your desk to find that <a

                                Then you have this entire eco-system of FOSS Js libraries supported by the community
                                that work every now and then which let you solve the problem of optimizing static

                                Eventually you are forced to choose, learn, test and integrate
                                all this bunch of tools just to put a website online with 5-10 views and 2-3
                                payment methods in most cases.

                                I though well, I hope we are not sacrificing proper modelling...
                                Object modelling? you write 1 input markup using ng-model in <a
                                href='https://angularjs.org/'>AngularJS</a> and it's in the model per se, this
                                by all means makes really difficult to keep the discipline we had back in the day
                                discussing
                                15 minutes about why we need an extra attribute in this object,
                                as instead the model is the Wild West.

                                No cowboy in your team knows exactly how many fields
                                it has or what's going on inside of it, seems rather frustrating because
                                it's part of the bargain, some might say it's the charm of it, like having to chose
                                between:

                                This is the brand new project I am working on lately, started on 23/04/2015, that's 9
                                weeks from today,
                                it is entirely developed in my spare time, as usual.

                            </p>

                            <p>
                                It all began with this <a
                                href='http://thepracticalsysadmin.com/running-elk-on-docker/'>article</a>.<br></br>
                                Was really exciting to see what <a href='https://www.docker.com/'>Docker</a> is able to
                                do, ELK stack was
                                quick
                                and easy to build following the tutorial, but soon I though maybe we could do something
                                interesting with the
                                <a
                                    href='https://www.elastic.co/'>Elastic Search</a>.<br></br>
                                So taking some random but useful data, in this case RSS news to persist on the Elastic
                                Search, gave me the
                                need
                                for a Client/Server scenario, therefore it came the <a href='https://angularjs.org/'>AngularJS</a>
                                client
                                and the <a href='https://nodejs.org/'>NodeJS</a> API to communicate the back-end
                                docker-based virtual
                                machines
                                with
                                the SPA <a
                                href='https://angularjs.org/'>AngularJS</a> web client.
                            </p>

                            <p>
                                At this point it would be nice if we could automate deployments and test coverage
                                reports, I used to
                                have a website online the last 3 years, it was completely unpleasant to maintain the
                                dev/release cycle
                                adding
                                new features to the website and making releases in my spare time, including testing
                                after the release.

                            </p>

                            <p>
                                I promised <a href='http://es.linkedin.com/in/sloppylopez'>myself</a> the next project
                                must have a CI-CD
                                cycle, it was very easy to achieve using the
                                wonders of <a href='https://travis-ci.org/sloppylopez/angulpar'>Travis</a> mixed up with
                                <a href='https://www.firebase.com/'>Firebase</a> <a

                                features.<br></br>
                                If we include <a href='https://github.com/sloppylopez'>Github</a> in the process, we
                                have
                                version control
                                in a powerful combination that removes tons of boilerplate work and process failures in
                                all the phases
                                of the dev/release cycle.
                            </p>

                            <p>
                                If we add 100% unit test coverage and e2e testing to the mix, topped up with <a
                                href='https://www.npmjs.com/package/istanbul'>Istambul</a> test coverage <a
                                href='https://codeclimate.com/github/sloppylopez/angulpar/coverage'>reports</a> and <a
                                href='https://codeclimate.com/github/sloppylopez/angulpar'>Code Climate</a> quality
                                checks, we find ourselves with a project resistant to human mistakes
                                across the whole cycle of dev/release.

                            </p>

                            <p>
                                The project is measurable, paired with <a
                                href='http://www.google.com/analytics/ce/mws/?utm_expid=71218119-7.lBgmrTO8R3uEDwsxNxa_Nw.1&utm_referrer=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.google.co.uk%2F'>Google
                                Analytics</a> gives the interesting possibility of measuring
                                the business value added for that feature, in that particular pull request.
                                We can measure how affects the performance of the web with tools like <a
                                href='https://gtmetrix.com/reports/sloppylopez.com/MDmkiX0B'>GTmetrix</a> and how
                                affects the <a href='https://codeclimate.com/github/sloppylopez/angulpar'>quality</a> of
                                code.<br></br>
                                if the pull
                                request diminishes the quality, the deployment will not happen and Travis will
                                automatically generate a
                                report.
                            </p>

                            <p>
                                After achieving this milestone we can focus on just adding business value to our
                                project,
                                that's <a href='http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Agile_management'>Agile</a>.<br></br>
                                We built a bare bones seed, with the minimum number of features to make the whole stack
                                work,
                                which also is ready for future growth and unavoidable human failures.<br></br>
                                We also have a clear and well defined process that anyone can follow and is documented,
                                idempotent,
                                automated and generates reports out-of-the-box.

                                and processes,
                                they put a 'start-up' approach over the table since all the members of the team are
                                involved
                                in the dev/release cycle.

                                Figures like 'Release Manager' as for example become less relevant in the process, the
                                testing phase of
                                the cycle gets partially released of stress as well, in a big corporation this can be a
                                fair amount of
                                money.

                                The funny thing is that it possibly took Travis less time to verify if this website
                                works, send a
                                report to Code Climate and deploy the latest code in Firebase than it took you to read
                                this brief
                                introduction
                                to this humble project.
